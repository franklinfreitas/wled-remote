Enbrighten Remote - Web Based for WLED
=====================================================
Requirements: 
  A webserver
  If you are using ESP32 stle board with WLED, this provides you with direct REST API access.
  The API endpoint (WLED) supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests from your browser.  
    This allows the browser to make requests directly to the device without requiring an 
    intermediary (like Flask).
  If the device doesn’t provide a direct REST API, you might need Flask to build a backend 
    that acts as a bridge between the browser and the device.
  This is all designed to run LOCALLY (e.g. friends come over, scan a QR code, the local 
    remote-control appears on phone, people can change colors)
    
Why the Embrighten "Cafelights" remote?
=====================================================
WLED, to my knowledge, provides no kiosk mode, or no multi user support.  This means family members
are greeted with the WLED web interface.  Someone who just wants mood lighting for a small gathering
needs to navigate through the endless customization for lights, and has access to admin functions.

Also to my knowledge, there is no bluetooth/rf interface to interact with an ESP32 style board.  

We have the Enbrighten Café Lights outside.  The remote control is super simple, can do just a handful of 
predefined effects, and offers 1 piece of customization.

The project: literally replicate the functionality of the Enbrighten Café Lights remote control so that
anyone using this web interface can simply tap something, and the lights do that thing.

The Enbrighten Café Lights remote control fucntions
=====================================================
On / Off: self explanitory.  State is stored so it knows when the lights are on and off.  Making this button a toggle.
Fade: The lights will fade in and out through all of the colors in a random pattern.
Dimming: Press the dimming button to choose one of 10 different light levels.  This works, but not as well as the real lights.  
      With WLED you don't notice a brightness drop from 255 to 230 very much.  Each press drops brightness down about 25
      points.  You notice the changes after a few presses.  After 10 presses you go back to 255.
Strobe:  The lights will strobe through all of the colors in a random pattern.  WLED's strobe is a bit more "Rave / Club" strobe.
2hr Timer: By pressing the 2 Hour Timer button, you will activate a two-hour countdown until lights turn off.
4hr Timer: By pressing the 4 Hour Timer button, you will activate a four-hour countdown until lights turn off.
Dual-Color Selection Feature
  Color 1:  Select a color from the color pad, press Color 1
  Color 2,  select a color from the color pad, press Color 2
    This is just a segment.  Color1 and Color2 become varaibles.  These 2 values are thrown in a string with a predefined segment
    length of 20 each 
Modes (with the official Embrighted color effect defination): 
Press the “modes” button repeatedly to cycle through the following preset modes:
Twinkle: A rainbow of colors, fading slowly and changing colors
Multi Fade: An extremely slow fade of each bulb through all of the colors
Christmas: Red, White, Green, (repeat)
St. Patrick’s Day: Green, Green, White, (repeat)
Red, white and blue: Red, White, Blue, (repeat)
Fall: Orange, Light Orange, (repeat)
Spring: Teal, Purple, Grteen, Yellow, (repeat)
Multi: all colors on the remote starting at upper-left, moving down, and ending up at pink

Some are obvious segments.  Some are up for interpretation (e.g. Twinkle and multi fade).  
"Multi" would require 12 segments.  I'm not that psychotic. I just picked some multi-color preset and set speed to 0.
